## Project Description
Expand an application called Taskmaster, using the existing codebase from the first version. The project consisted in creating a new design that incorporates new features, resulting in an improved user experience.

The project adds the ability to edit tasks and dates. Using jQuery UI, dragging and dropping functionality was implemented within and between the status columns.
